# Awesome-Self-hosting-for-the-whole-family
Self-hosting is the process of locally hosting and managing applications instead of renting from SaaS providers. And 9 times out of 10 it results in a frustrated spouse or family members who end up using "the cloud" anyway because they can't figure out how to use the server you setup.

This is a list for those of us who primarily live on our mobile devices, or have family members who do, but still want the privacy, security, and control over our own data that self-hosting provides.

The goal of this list is to curate all self-hosted services available that have mobile counterparts.

* All services must have a native Android and iOS app to make the list, or at the very least have apps in active development.
* PWAs (Progressive web apps) unfortunately do not qualify an app for this list. Atleast not until Apple allows better integration of them on iOS, and stops refreshing them every time you switch to another app. For now they are just too cumbersome, atleast on iOS. 
* 3rd party apps are ok, so long as it offers all core functionality of the service it is designed to work with.
* The mobile apps must not need Root or Jailbreak, and must be available through an official Appstore.
* Open source is always preferable, however Proprietary, paid, or even services that need specific/proprietary hardware are all welcome here. This is about ease of use, not soapboxing for FOSS. The intent here is getting people out of the cloud. 
* The app must beable to function outside of your home network, eg. a DLNA server really doesnt belong on this list, it can work through a VPN but that outside the scope of this list.

[**Delta Chat**](https://delta.chat/en/)
  * INFO/Requirements:

    * Does not have its own backend server. Instead Delta Chat relies on using the existing email standards.

  * Description:
    * Delta Chat is like Telegram or Whatsapp but without the tracking or central control. Check out our GDPR compliancy statement. Delta Chat doesn’t have their own servers but uses the most massive and diverse open messaging system ever: the existing e-mail server network. Chat with anyone if you know their e-mail address, no need for them to install DeltaChat! All you need is a standard e-mail account.
